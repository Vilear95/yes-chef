        Ingredients
            <ul>
                <li>-6 white potatoes</li>
                <li>-3 Eringi mushrooms</li>
                <li>-1 large white onion, or 2 medium white onions.</li>
                <li>-1 sprig of rosemary.</li>
                <li>-Butter. I suggest 2 tablespoons (30ml), but you could always used a bit more.</li>
                <li>-2 packs of thick-cut bacon.</li>
                <li>-1 cup, or 250ml of red wine. We used a Pinot Noir since its preferable for cooking.</li>
                <li>-1/4 cup, or 60ml of sake. Any sake that is labeled as “sweet” should do.</li>
                <li>-2 tbs, or 30ml of soy sauce.</li>
                <li>-1 spring of parsley or any garnish.</li> 
            </ul>
